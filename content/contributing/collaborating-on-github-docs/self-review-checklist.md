Before you submit your changes to the {% data variables.product.prodname_docs %} team for review, work through the list below to complete your self review.

* Changes meet the **content goals and user needs** in the content design plan, if one has been created.
* Content has been **confirmed for accuracy** by a subject matter expert (SME) in the technical area.
* Content satisfies {% data variables.product.github %}'s **documentation fundamentals** that are required for all content. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/about-githubs-documentation-fundamentals).
* The article **renders properly on staging** for each version of the article (Free Pro Team, GHEC, GHES).
* All **pull request checks** are passing.
