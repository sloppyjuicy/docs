>[!NOTE] CAP protection for web sessions is currently in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and may change.
>
> If IdP CAP support is already enabled for your enterprise, you can opt into extended protection for web sessions from your enterprise's "Authentication security" settings. To enable this feature, your enterprise must have 1,000 or fewer members, active or suspended.
> When web session protection is enabled and a user's IP conditions are not satisfied, they can view and filter all user-owned resources but cannot view the details of the results for notifications, searches, personal dashboards, or starred repositories.
